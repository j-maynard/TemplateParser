# Text Document Parser

This is a simple text parser which turns a text documents
such as HTML and XML documents in to a tree structure based
on custom start and end tags.  It also supports nested blocks.

This was written to allow the parsing of HTML documents in to a
tree structure to allow parts of the document to be removed
based on if it has content.
